Current strategy do not allow for anything other than a plane-1
Thought is toward the ability to target a point on the plane and not follow a single linear line array 
Rather allowing for a flexable strategy that can control the rate of current as needed for better management of the state of charge,the rate of charge induced and the rate of charge drain.
For a model this may be possible as the image can be tracked and monitored to XY from 0 empty to 1
The target empty and target max models can be designed based on the parameters that can be used to characterize the coefficients and the laws of the coefficients against the image making a float point.
The exact qualities of the empty target and the exact qualities of the the full target will characterize the linear plane of the 4th dimensional plane or the linear plane-1 for Z. All 3 elements will have various rates of change to each other. Singularity only occurs for i. X and Y have inverse behaviour to Z so if Z rises or falls X and Y change width and height in respect to expansion at different rates. Provided are eight relationship examples for element behavior to each other. Plot each element relationship to the other for min amd max values. If desired 2d plot Z as negative moving to -1. For 3d plot Y width, X height, Z 0-1 scope and 1 to 0 scope and I 0-1 and 1 to 0 scope. Shape is 3d to each elements relationship to each other. As stated fluid and dynamic. Previous thoughts had been toward the old designs with z constant and y having a constant and only x was targeted as being max at plane-1 The specific equation used in this case is constant current so current represented size will not change in total volume. Suggest using a sphere as a starting point and plot each element as it moves away from xy to see the behavior. As we have three elements, plus the unknown difference of weighted members ,now calculated, and the image itself. Creating 4 none linear movements plus the movement from empty to full. Plus expensation in height width. 
The linear plane will be able to represent the level of the state of charge as it tracks the current induced or the current drained, but now all three elememts are variables. So we are tracking net induced current in watt over time not just Voltage. Training should be toward the best total watts over time for the size of your device in the instance of a battery with a 20watt-hour rating target the proper specifications. Theoretically this was my original intent. Desire is to be able to remove the constant current and plot a planned rate of charge over time with various rates to increase or decrease current when needed against loss fron drain or slowing rate due to heat. Increase in weighted members would increase volume "weighting down" the image pulling it off of its desired path for proper growth. Now we adjust for weight, account for loss to factors otherwise out of our control and use optimization to correct for variances, when appropriate.
Being able to know the exact qualities of the target can flexibly manage the current flow with reference sensors used for temperature managment, current flow managment.
When we introduce current the factor time is introduced and as current is induced volume grows from minimum watt hours to max watt hours tthis causes the object to grow in volume as desired. 
The electrons are the constant flow of of substance and the wires and resistance are the pipes restricting the current or limiting the flow in a <---negative direction, upward with amperage, downward with volts
The size of the pipes voltage and amperage contUpwards with current induced, downward with current drained.
Looking for the weak link and improving the weak link where possible. Looking for a new angle towards the situation that causes the limiting factor.

The shape of the image object is characterized by the elements that make up the image. I max and I min are boundaries of the image. When ++i or --i are of an offset to the original image width and height the boundaries(limits)  of the object and its character are changed. When the characteristics of the elements shapes that make up the image object change the object shape changes. A dispersment to the shape of the object. When an element shape fluctuate by their defined boundaries each element height or width is changed. Convergence accures when the normal behavior of the elements returns and the image object retutns to its normal defined character.When weighted members are actually constant and voltage and amperage remain constant for a power supply but only if weights  stay the same. When elements change the image will change its normal shape due to undefined behavior the shape of the object and its elements become unpredictable and final charge relatively unknown ad simply knowing the voltage doesnt tell us about the reserve watt hours. "Pool". When reshaping of the object and its elements is performed the resulting float point of the image object is not at the same point even though its shape has convergence. Whrn this occures new boundaries have been defined. And adjustment to strategies for defines must be made to adjust for the new characteristic behavior of the image object. Thus new limits and boundaries and paths from 0 to 1 are made. If 0 is the low state  at a defined point and max is a high state 1 at a defined point and strategies of boundaries are defined and all characteristic behavior are able to be defined then the float point of the image object can be tracked from the low state to the high state.
