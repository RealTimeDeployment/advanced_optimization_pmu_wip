Precision & Flexibility
Current strategy do not allow for anythimg other than a plane-1 Instead of following a plane-1

Thought is toward the ability to target a point on the plane and not follow a single linear line array 
Rather allowing for a flexable strategy that can control the rate of current as needed for better management of the state of charge,the rate of charge induced and the rate of charge drain.
For a 4D model this may be possible as the "linear" plane can be tracked and monitored.
The target empty and target max models can be designed based on the parameters that can be used to characterize the coefficients and the laws of the coefficients to a 3D model similar to a cube, but more flexible and dynamic
The exact qualities of the empty target and the exact qualities of the the full target will characterize the linear plane of the 4th dimensional plane or the linear plane-1
The linear plane will be able to represent the level of the state of charge as it tracks the current induced or the current drained
being able to know the exact qualities of the target can flexibly manage the current flow with reference sensors used for temperature managment, current flow managment.
Flexible coefficient's controllable for rate of induction and rate of drain so that the model would be more like a fluid dynamics model as current flow is more characteristically like a fluid or the current of a river 
The electrons are the constant flow of of substance and the wires and resistance are the pipes restricting the current or limiting the flow in a <---negative direction
The size of the pipes voltage and amperage control the rate of flowflow ---> positive direction toward the negative as a river flows down stream within its banks and its banks are not always the same width or depth.
When current is not needed the voltage and amperage will be decreased. When current is needed voltage and amperage will be increased.
This will require the use of %shaders, which is not currently supported to this extent.A new module and a new support for arrays and view creation.As standard arrays will not tolerate such flexibility.
