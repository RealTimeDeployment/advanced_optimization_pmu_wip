Precision & Flexibility
Current strategy's do not allow for flexibility when environmental variables change.
A flexable strategy that can control the rate of current as needed.
Better management of the state of charge.
Accounting for the current induced, current drained, and losses not accounted for.
For a model this may be possible as the image can be tracked and monitored from a low state of charge to a full state of charge.
Using the laws of physics to characterize the elements that make up the object.
All 3 elements have various rates of change to each other and effect each other.
Tracking net induced current in watt over time.
Training should be toward the best total watts over time for the size of your device.
A planned rate of charge over time with various rates to increase or decrease current when needed.
Watching loss from drain or slowing rate due to heat.
An increase in weighted members would increase volume "weighting down" the target pulling it off of its desired path for proper charging.
Now we can account for loss to factors otherwise out of our control and use optimization to correct for these variances.
Being able to know the exact qualities of the target can flexibly manage the current flow. Using reference sensors for temperature managment, and current flow managment.
When we introduce current the factor time is introduced and as current is induced volume grows from minimum watt hours to max watt hours.
The electrons are the constant flow of a substance. The wires and resistance are the pipes restricting the current or limiting the flow in a negative way.
The shape of the image object is characterized by the elements that make up the image. 
Min and Max capacity are boundaries of the image. When ++i or --i are of an offset to the original image width and height the limits of the object and its character are changed. When the characteristics of the target object change the object shape changes. When an element shape fluctuates its height or width is changed.
When elements change the image will change its normal shape due to undefined behavior the shape of the object and its elements become unpredictable and final charge relatively unknown. Simply knowing the voltage doesnt tell us about the reserve watt hours. "Pool". When reshaping of the object and its elements is performed the resulting float point of the image object is not at the same point even though its shape has returned to a normal state. When this occures new boundaries have been defined. Adjustments to strategies for defines must be made to adjust for the new characteristic behavior of the image object. Thus new limits, boundaries and paths to a full state of charge are made. If the low state at a defined point and max is at  a defined point, and boundaries are defined with all characteristic behavior then the float point of the image object can be tracked from the low state to the high state.
